# YGO-small-world

[Small World](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=16555&request_locale=en) is a *Yu-Gi-Oh!* card which is notorious for being difficult to understand. The idea is that you reveal a card from your hand, reveal a card from your deck with exactly one property in common with your original card out of attack, defense, level, type, and attribute, then reveal a third card also with exactly one property in common with the second card, and add that third card to your hand.

In theory, Small World can search any monster from your deck and add it to your hand. However, it may not be possible to bridge a card in your hand to the card that you want to search. The first card you reveal in your deck is referred to as the Small World *bridge* which connects the card you reveal in your hand and the card you add to your hand.

If you use Small World, it is generally desirable to include one or more dedicated Small World bridges that connects many cards in your deck so you have plenty of options for what to search starting from any card. However, such cards are difficult to find due to the many ways that cards can be considered connected via Small World. Because of the difficulty in optimizing a deck for Small World, there is a high barrier of entry to use the card.

The purpose of this repository is to assist in finding the best Small World bridges for any deck.

## üìä Dataset

The card data `cardinfo.json` is obtained from the [Yu-Gi-Oh! API](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/).

## üîß Installation

### Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/KennethJAllen/YGO-small-world
cd YGO-small-world
```
### Install Dependencies with Poetry:

*   Install Poetry from Poetry official website if not already installed.
*   Run the following command in the project directory:

```
poetry install
```
### Activate the Virtual Environment:
```
poetry shell
```
You can now run the project's scripts within the poetry shell.

## üíª Running the Code

### Using the Notebook

* Initial Setup: Open `examples/bridge_generator_examples.ipynb` and run the cell under `Import Module`.
* Update Card Data: If needed, update card info using fetch_card_data.py

### Finding Bridges
* From a List of Names:
  * To find bridges for a specific deck, edit `deck_monster_names` in the cell under `Find Best Bridges From List of Names` with your main deck monster names.
  * If certain cards are essential for bridge connections, edit `required_target_names`. If not, do not use that argument.
  * Ensure card names exactly match their official names, which can be verified on the [Yu-Gi-Oh! card database](https://ygoprodeck.com/card-database/).

### Using YDK Files
* File Preparation: Place your .ydk file in the YGO-small-world directory.
* Running the Analysis: Replace mathmech_deck.ydk with your file's name in the cell under Find Best Bridges From YDK File.
  * Note: Side deck monsters are included in the analysis.

## üé¥ Example

Consider a Mathmech deck consisting of the monsters
```
'Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring',
'D.D. Crow',
'Effect Veiler',
'Ghost Belle & Haunted Mansion',
'Mathmech Addition',
'Mathmech Circular',
'Mathmech Diameter',
'Mathmech Multiplication',
'Mathmech Nabla',
'Mathmech Sigma',
'Mathmech Subtraction',
'Nibiru, the Primal Being',
'PSY-Frame Driver',
'PSY-Framegear Gamma'.
```
Then the graph of connections via Small World can be visualized as follows.

The adjacency matrix corresponding to cards in a Mathmech deck is the following matrix. If an entry is black, that means the corresponding cards connect via Small World. If an entry is white, that means there is no connection.

<img src="https://github.com/KennethJAllen/YGO-small-world/blob/main/examples/images/sample-adjacency-matrix.png" width="500" />

Squaring the adjacency matrix, we get the following figure. If an entry is non-white, that means that one corresponding card can be searched from the other. The darker the color, the more connecting bridges the two cards have.

Every entry in the column corresponding to [Mathmech Circular](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17430) is non-zero except for the entry corresponding to [Mathmech Multiplication](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=14748), which means that Mathmech Circular can be searched with Small World starting from any monster in the deck except Mathmech Multiplication.

Moreover, the diagonal entries are the number of connections a card has to another card in the deck. The darker the entry, the more connections a card has to other cards in the deck.

To generate your own figures, use the `examples/graph_adacency_visualizer.ipynb` notebook.

## üåê Small World Mathematics
We can use [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) to calculate which cards can and cannot be searched via Small World starting from any card.

We can model the monsters in a deck as the vertices of an undirected graph $G$. Define an edge between monsters $i$ and $j$ if they are a valid connections between each other for Small World. e.g. [Ash Blossom](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=12950) and [Effect Veiler](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=8933) would have an edge connecting them because they the same attack but have different types, attributes, defense, and level. However, Ash Blossom and [Ghost Belle](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=13587) would not have an edge connecting them 

Let $n$ be the number of distinct monsters in your deck. Label the distinct monsters in your deck is $1$ through $n$. e.g. 'Ash Blossom' is $1$, 'Effect Veiler' is $2$, 'Ghost Belle' is $3$, etc. Let $M$ be the $n \times n$ adjacency matrix of the graph $G$. There is a one in entry $(i,j)$ in $M$ if there is an edge between monster $i$ and monster $j$, with zeros everywhere else. In other words, there is a $1$ in entry $(i,j)$ if monster $i$ and monster $j$ connect through Small World. In this case, entry $(1,2)$ would have a $1$ because Ash Blossom and Effect Veiler connect, but entry $(1,3)$ would be $0$ because Ash Blossom and Ghost Belle do not connect because they have the same level, attack, defense, and type.

### Theorem

Starting with monster $i$, you can search monster $j$ with Small World if and only if entry $(i,j)$ is non-zero in the matrix $M^2$.

### Proof

Entry $(i,j)$ in $M^2$ is equal to the number of paths of length $2$ from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ in $G$ (see [properties of the adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix)). If entry $(i,j)$ is zero, then there are no bridges between monsters $i$ and $j$. If entry $(i,j)$ is non-zero, then there is at least one bridge from $i$ to $j$, so $j$ can be searched starting with $i$.

### Bridge Score

When using the `small_world_bridge_finder` notebook, there is a `bridge_score` output for each potential bridge to add to a deck. The score is a way of measuring the resulting connectivity of your deck after adding that bridge. A score of $1$ means that every card is searchable from every other card, and a bridge score of $0$ means that there are no cards you can search with Small World, no matter what card you start with.

More specifically, the bridge score for any particular bridge is the number of cards in the deck, including the bridge, which are searchable starting from other cards in the deck, including the bridge, divided by $(n+1)^2$.

In more mathematical terms, consider a potential bridge $b$. Let $M$ be the $n \times n$ adjacency matrix generated by the input deck. Let $x$ be the $n \times 1$ vector corresponding to the bridge $b$ which has a $1$ in entry $i$ if card $i$ in the deck connects to the bridge and is zero otherwise. Then the adjacency matrix for the deck, including the bridge $b$, is the $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ matrix

```math
M_b = \begin{bmatrix}M & x\\x^\top & 0\end{bmatrix}.
```

Then the bridge score is calculated as the number of non-zero elements in $M_b^2$ divided by $(n+1)^2$.

Because of the block matrix structure of $M_b$, we can express its square as

```math
M_b^2 = \begin{bmatrix}M^2 + xx^\top & Mx\\x^\top M & x^\top x\end{bmatrix}.
```

Because $M$ is symmetric, $x^\top M = (Mx)^\top$. So to calculate $M_b^2$ we only need to calculate $M^2$ once. Then for each potential bridge $b$, we calculate $xx^\top$, $Mx$, and $x^\top x$.

If there are $m$ possible bridges $b$, then calculating the Small World bridge score for every bridge with this approach only takes $O(mn^2)$ multiplications. This is much better than the naive approach of performing the full matrix multiplication for $M_b^2$ for each bridge $b$, which would take $O(mn^3)$ multiplications.
